# CPP_Pokemon_Battle_Game
This is the basic pokemon battle game that i created for PPJ class.

 The player and the CPU are each given 4 Pokemon.
 If you want to change the pokemon's "10101" will randomize all your pokemon 
 You can end the game if you type "0"
	
 Following each match, the user is given the option of selecting any other Pokemon.
 The winner is determined after all 4 matches are completed.

 The player must choose one Pokemon to fight in the first round against its 
 corresponding CPU Pokemon.

 I couldn't add 'Evolve' and without evolve game was basic. So I wanted to make it
 more complicated :) There are 4 parameters

Dexterity, Attack, Defence, Special

 Dexterity outpowers Defence but is outpowered by Attack

 Attack outpowers Dexterity but is outpowered by Defence

 Defencs outpowers Attack but is outpowered by Dexterity

 Special is a one-time move that either multiplies any of your abilities or doubles 
 your health.

Following each match, the user is given the option of selecting any other Pokemon.
The winner is determined after all four matches are completed.
